## Bio

I am a Final Year Bachelor of Business Studies student specialising in Data Analytics at [Dublin City University](https://www.dcu.ie/).
Passionate about uncovering insights from data, I am dedicated to leveraging statistical methods and cutting-edge technologies to drive informed decision-making and solve complex business challenges.

Currently, I balance my studies with part-time work at the [Guinness Storehouse](https://www.guinness-storehouse.com/en/home). Here, I work as part of the Visitor Experience team, ensuring visitors have a satisfactory visit at the [World's Leading Tourist Attraction](https://www.guinness-storehouse.com/en/whats-hoppening/worlds-leading-tourist-attraction).

Through this academic website, I aim to showcase my proficiency in data analysis by presenting a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my skills in data collection, cleaning, visualisation, and interpretation. From predictive modelling to trend analysis, I am committed to utilising data-driven approaches to deliver actionable insights and create value for organisations.
